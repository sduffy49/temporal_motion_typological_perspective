# temporal_motion_typological_perspective

This repository contains the data for the paper "On the path of time: Temporal motion in typological perspective" by Michele I. Feist and Sarah E. Duffy, currently accepted for publication by the journal Language and Cognition.

The data consists of random 200-token samples of each of the ten most frequent path and manner verbs in Spanish and in English, extracted from the Corpus del Español (Davies, 2002–), from the BYU-BNC (Davies, 2004–), and from the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA; Davies, 2010–). (See Feist & Duffy, in press, for details.)

In addition, each file includes a sheet listing all of the motion verbs in Cifuentes-Férez's (2008) taxonomy along with their lemma frequency (frequencies for some self-contained motion verbs have been omitted, as self-contained motion is incompatible with the metaphors examined in this study) in the Corpus del Español or the BYU-BNC, as appropriate, and Cifuentes-Férez's codes for type of motion (self-contained or translational) and semantic components encoded.
